In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method to unify four IE subtasks, including named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), event extraction (EE), and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). The whole framework can be called **TransferUIE**. It contains two main parts:  Instructed Graph Decode and Task-Specific Regularization.
